# Peakfijn ❤️ NextJS

Peakfijn loves [NextJS][link-nextjs], that's why this template project exists.
It contains all basic standards and features of Peakfijn, ready to rock.

## What's included?

- **Everything is TypeScript** — helps us focusing on code instead of documentation, and catches bugs early
- **Absolute imports with `src/`** — import files using their absolute path, like `src/atoms/typography`
- **Atomic design folder structure** — helps us maintain a dependency tree, not a spiderweb from hell
- **Test with Jest & Testing Library** — an amazing toolkit to tests components and more
- **Pipeline configuration** — predefined pipeline configuration to get up and running instantly
- **Peakfijn linters** — all our standards and conventions ready to go
- **Deploy to Heroku** — focus on the project, not server maintenance
- **Pluggable packages** — some projects require different integrations, they are plug-and-play if you need it
